   ______________________________________________________________________

1.5. Todo

   Here are some things that should be done ... Note that some of these
   entries are just some ideas, which may be done in the long run.

   If you plan to help me, please send a mail at <fcron@free.fr> to
   prevent two people from doing the same thing. You can send me some
   propositions as well, or ask me to move something to the top of the
   heap ;) .

1.5.1. High priority

     * mails from B. Wohler : improve the doc + change (?) the name of
       fcrondyn -> fcronc ??
     * problem with daylight savings ? ("already running" ...) (cf.
       Nick's mails -- Warning : he has a new address))
     * add a new FAQ entry : what should be done to completely replace
       vixie cron by fcron ? Are there some incompatibilities ?
     * add an option to prevent fcron from running a job if the system is
       running on battery (anacron does it ?)
     * create a mailing list for help/user support : send a mail on
       fcronannounce + news on web site to advertise it.

1.5.2. Low priority

     * code cleaning : create a .c/.h file for data structures (file/line
       lists, serial queue, lavg list, exe list), and work with them only
       through functions/macros.
       Note : thoroughly check for bugs which can be introduced during
       the code cleaning (make sure that after the modification, the code
       executed is still the same as before !).
     * Mem footprint reduction : for fcron processes which are aimed at
       running sendmail, free() some memory (file/line lists, queues,
       ...) (but does it worth it ? takes too much exe time for few
       memory ?)
       Also use an/some union(s) in CL struct.
     * implement more commands for fcrondyn, and make it more secure and
       reliable
     * add a timezone option instead of the tzdiff (so it would look like
       !timezone(europe/paris)) (?)
     * For environment settings, make a var substitution.
     * add a return code for jobs which would mean that they should not
       be run again (in case of an error, etc...).
     * Use directory notifications (?) (portable ?) (cf. dnotify)
     * PAM support (included in fcron, but needs more tests by people
       using PAM - not implemented in fcrondyn : is it needed in fcrondyn
       anyway ?)

1.5.3. Ideas

     * add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some modules
       (.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it calls a
       function of the module, and let it manage the job (threads ?). (do
       linux dlopen(), etc exist on other systems ? - yes : thanks
       Harring ;) dlopen exists on all POSIX system - even windoze -
       abait it does not use the same insterface of function calls. But
       it can be easily implemented to port to another system.).
     * (related to the system of modules ? create a kind of dependencies
       ?) Add a way to run a job only if a command returns true. It would
       permit, for instance, to run some jobs on a laptop only if it is
       on AC power.
     * add a system of data flow
     * Add a way to stop a job (SIGSTOP) if the lavg gets to high, and
       restart it (SIGCONT) when the lavg has decreased.
     * Add a timeout for task completion : if a task takes more than a
       specified timeout, then start another script with the initial task
       PID as argument. That would allow a kill with different signals
       (-HUP, -TERM -STOP, .... or any other action like sending a mail
       to sysadmin to alert him/her that a task is taking too much time
       and that he has to have a look at it.)
     * Add a directory similar to xinet.d or logrotate.d to add job
       entries (?).
