To install fcron on your system :
---------------------------------

 - uncompress the archive :
	tar -xzf fcron-X.Y.Z.src.tar.gz

 - cd to the archive directory
	cd fcron-X.Y.Z

 - run the configure script :
	./configure

   Notes : The command "make install" asks you by default some questions
           you have to answer. To avoid that (which can be useful for automatic
           installers), you can use the ./configure's option --with-answer-all
           (see "./configure --help" for more details).

           You may also want to change the place where fcron will be installed:
           you can use the configure's option --prefix to do that.
           For instance : ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
           (default is prefix=/usr)

           To disable the use of PAM, use configure's option --with-pam=no.

           To debug fcron, you should use configure's option --with-debug .

           You can get info on the others configure's options by running
           "./configure --help".

   Warning : The configure script may not define a correct directory
             for the man pages and the documentation on some systems.
             You may check the values defined by configure and if necessary
             force a value by the options --mandir and -with-docdir
             (see the help by running "./configure --help").

             If you get older fcron's man-pages with "man" command after having
             upgraded, it's probably because fcron has changed its default man
             directory : you should remove manually the outdated man-pages.

             The Makefile has been designed for GNU make. Some other version
             of make may fail to use it.

 - check the file config.h, and change it if necessary
   (the configurable part is on the top of the file and clearly delimited).

 - compile :
	make

 - then install binaries as root :
	su root
	make install

You can now run fcron and fcrontab.

Notes : 
	This is a POSIX conforming software. You must have a POSIX compiler
	(gcc for example) in order to compile it.

	This software has been written for GNU/Linux systems. If you want
	to port	it on an other Unix platform (thank you if you do it), try
	to modify - if possible - only the configure script.
	Please send me any modifications at <fcron@free.fr> in order
	to include it in future releases.
