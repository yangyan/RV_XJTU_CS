<H2>NAME</H2>

fcrontab - tables for driving fcron
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

A fcrontab is a file containing all tables used by the
<B>fcron</B>(8)

daemon. In other words, it is the means for a user to tell the daemon
&quot;execute this command at this moment&quot;. Each user has his own fcrontab,
whose commands are executed as his owner (only root can run a job as another
using the option
<B>runas</B> (see below)).

<P>

Blank lines, line beginning by a pound-sign (#) (which are considered
comments), leading blanks and tabs are ignored. Each line in a fcrontab file
can be either
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>an environment setting,<DD>
<DT>an option setting,<DD>
<DT>entries based on elapsed system up time,<DD>
<DT>entries based on absolut time<DD>
<BR>

(like normal crontab entries), or
<DT>entries run periodically.<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

Any logical line (an entry or an assignment)
can be divided into several real lines (the lines which end by a newline
character) by placing a backslash (\) before the newline character (\n). 
<P>

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The environment settings</H3>

The environment settings are of the form
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name&nbsp;=&nbsp;value
<P>

where the blanks around equal-sign (=) are ignored and optional. Trailing
blanks are also ignored, but you can place the value in quotes (simple or
double, but matching) to preserve any blanks in the value.
<P>

When fcron executes a command, it always sets
<B>USER</B>, <B>HOME</B>, and <B>SHELL</B> as defined in

<I>/etc/passwd</I>

for the owner of the fcrontab from which the command is
extracted.
<B>HOME</B> and <B>SHELL</B>

may be overridden by settings in the fcrontab, but
<B>USER</B>

may not.
Every other environment assignments defined in the user fcrontab are then
made, and the command is executed.
<P>

Plus, the special variable 
<B>MAILTO </B>

allows you to tell fcron to whom it has
to mail the command's output. Note that
<B>MAILTO</B>

is in fact equivalent to a global declaration of the option 
<B>mailto</B> (see below).

It is only used for backward compatibility, so you should use the option
<B>mailto</B> directly.

<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Entries based on elapsed system up time</H3>

The entries of commands which have to be run once every m minutes of fcron's
execution (which is normally the same as m minutes of system's execution)
are of the form
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@options&nbsp;frequency&nbsp;command
<P>

where frequency is a time value of the form
value*multiplier+value*multiplier+...+value-in-minutes as &quot;12h02&quot;
or &quot;3w2d5h1&quot;. The first means &quot;12 hours and 2 minutes of fcron execution&quot;
while the second means &quot;3 weeks, 2 days, 5 hours and 1 minute of fcron
execution&quot;. The only valid multipliers are: 
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>multipliers</I>

<DD>
<I>meaning</I>

<DT>m<DD>
months (4 weeks)
<DT>w<DD>
weeks (7 days)<TT>&nbsp;</TT><BR>
<DT>d<DD>
days (24 hours)
<DT>h<DD>
hours (60 minutes)
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

In place of options, user can put a time value : it will be interpreted as 
@first(time). If first option is not set, the value of &quot;frequency&quot; is used.
<P>

This kind of entry does not guarantee a time and date of execution (as the job
is delayed at each startup by the time elapsed since the shutdown), but should
be useful for jobs depending on the number of things done by the users
(for instance, the filesystem should better be checked after an certain amount
of use by the users rather than every x days, as the system may run from 1 day
to x days during that x days interval).
<P>

The time remaining before next execution is saved every 1800 seconds
(to limit damages caused by a crash) and when fcron exits after having received
a SIGTERM signal, i.e. when systems go down. Thus, this kind of entries is
particularly useful for systems that don't run regularly. The syntax being
very simple, it may also useful for tasks which don't need to be run at
a specific time and date.
<P>

<I>see also</I> :

options<B> first, mail, nolog, serial, lavg, nice, runas</B> (see below).

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Entries based on time and date</H3>

The second type of fcrontab's entries begins by an optional &quot;&amp;&quot;, which can be
immediately followed by an optional number defining the frequency of
execution (this is equivalent to option 
<B>runfreq</B>) or a declaration of options;

it has five time and date fields, and a shell command. Note that the shell
command may be preceded by a user name, which is equivalent to 
<B>runas</B>(user): as it is only here for backward compatibility you should

use option <B>runas</B> (see below) instead.

The frequency is interpreted as: &quot;run this command after x matches
of time and date fields&quot;. The time and date fields are:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>field</I>

<DD>
<I>allowed values</I>

<DT>minute<DD>
0-59
<DT>hour<DD>
0-23
<DT>day of month<DD>
1-31
<DT>month<DD>
1-12 (or names, see below)
<DT>day of week<DD>
0-7 (0 and 7 are both Sunday, or names)
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

A field is always filled by either an asterisk (*), which acts as &quot;first-last&quot;
range, a single number or a list.
<P>

List are numbers or range separated with commas (,). For instance: &quot;2,5,15,23&quot;.
<P>

Ranges of number are of the form &quot;begin-end&quot;, where &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; are
included. For example, &quot;3-5&quot; specifies the values 3, 4 and 5. You can also
add an optional &quot;/number&quot; to a range, where the number specifies skips of the
number's value through the range.  For example, &quot;0-23/2&quot; can be used in
the hours field to specify command execution  every other hour. Finally,
one or several &quot;~number&quot; can be added to turn off some values in a range.
For example, &quot;5-8~6~7&quot; is equivalent to &quot;5,8&quot;. The final form of a field is:
&quot;a[-b[/c][~d][~e][...]][,f[-g[/h][~i][~j][...]]][,...]&quot;, where the letters
are integers.
<P>

You can also use an asterisk (*) in a field. It acts for &quot;first-last&quot;.
For example, a &quot;*&quot; in the field minute means all minutes from minute 0
down to minute 59.
<P>

<P>

Ranges can be included in a list as a single number. For instance:
&quot;2,5-10/2~6,15,20-25,30&quot;.
<P>

Names can also be used for  the &quot;month&quot;  and  &quot;day of week&quot; fields.
To do so, use the first three letters of the particular day or month
(case doesn't matter). Please note that names are used exactly as numbers:
you can use them in a list or a range.
<P>

If a day of month and a day of week are given, the command will execute only
when both match with the current time and date unless option
<B>dayor</B> is set.

For example, with the line &quot;5 10 31 * 7 echo ''&quot; , echo will be executed only
days which are a Sunday AND a 31th.
<P>

<I>see also</I> :

options<B> dayor, bootrun, runfreq, mail, nolog, serial, lavg, nice,</B>

<B>runas</B> (see below).

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Entries run periodically</H3>

The third type of fcrontab's entries begin by a &quot;%&quot;, followed by one of
the keywords :
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>hourly, daily, monthly, weekly,</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>midhourly, middaily, nightly, midmonthly, midweekly,</B>

<DD>
<DT><B>mins, hours, days, mons, dow.</B>

<DD>
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

and optional options.
<BR>

The keywords of the first line tell fcron to run the command once from
the beginning of the corresponding interval to the end of that interval : 
for instance, the keyword <B>weekly</B>

tells fcron to run a command once between Monday and Sunday each week.
On top of that, the second list acts similarly but from middle to middle of
the corresponding interval : <B>midweekly</B>

will run a command once from Thursday to Wednesday. 
Note that <B>nightly</B> is equivalent to <B>middaily</B>.

<BR>

With this two kind of keywords, user must give the needed time fields (as 
defined in &quot;Entries based on time and date&quot; (see above)) to specify when
the command should be run during each interval :
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>Keywords:</I>

<DD>
<I>must be followed by the fields:</I>

<DT><B>hourly, midhourly :</B>

<DD>
minutes.
<DT><B>daily, middaily, nightly, weekly, midweekly :</B>

<DD>
minutes and hours.
<DT><B>monthly, midmonthly :</B>

<DD>
minutes, hours and days.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>

For example : '%nightly * 21-23,3-5 echo &quot;a monthly entry&quot;'
<BR>

will run the command once each night either between 21:00 and 23:59, or between
3:00 and 5:59.
<P>

<I>see also</I> :

options<B> lavg, noticenotrun, strict, mail, nolog, serial, nice, runas</B>

(see below).
<P>
<P>

The keywords of the third list act differently, as follows:
<BR>

run this command once during EACH interval specified, ignoring the fields
below the keyword in the interval definition 
(a <B>hours</B> prevents the mins field to be considered as an interval,

but it will be used to determine when the line should be run during an 
interval : see the note below) (<B>dow</B> means

&quot;day of week&quot;).
<BR>

Such a keyword is followed by 5 time and date fields (the same fields used
for a line based on absolut time (see above)). 
Furthermore, there must be some non-matching time and dates in the lines
with that kind of keyword (i.e. the following is not allowed : 
&quot;%hours * 0-23 * * * echo&quot;, but &quot;%hours * 0-22 * * * echo&quot; is allowed).
<BR>

<I>Note</I> : a single number in a field is considered as an interval :

&quot;%mins 15 2-4 * * * echo&quot; will run at 2:15, 3:15 
<I>AND</I> 4:15 every day.

<BR>

But every fields below the keywords are ignored in interval definition :
&quot;%hours 15 2-4 * * * echo&quot; will run only ONCE either at 2:15, 3:15
<I>OR</I> 4:15.

<P>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Options</H3>

The options can be set either for every line below the declaration
or for an individual line. In the first case, the setting is done on a whole
line immediately after an exclamation mark (!), while it is done after
a &quot;&amp;&quot;, a &quot;%&quot; or a &quot;@&quot; depending on the type of scheduling in the second case.
Note that
an option declaration in a schedule overrides the global declaration of
that same
option.
<BR>

Options are separated by comas (,) and their arguments, if any, are placed
between brackets (&quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;) and separated by comas. No spaces are
allowed. A declaration of options is of the form
<P>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;option[(arg1[,arg2][...])][,option[(arg1[...])]][...]
<P>

where option is either the name of an option or its abbreviation.
The options are (abbreviation and default value between brackets):
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>reset </B>

<DD>
<I>boolean</I>

<BR>

Reset options to default.

<BR>

<I>see also</I> :

option<B> lavg, lavgand.</B>

<DT><B>strict</B>

<DD>
<I>boolean</I>(true)

<BR>

When a lavg %-job is at the end of an interval of execution, should it be
removed from the lavg queue (strict(true), so the job is not run) or be let
there until the system load average allows its execution (strict(false)) ?
<BR>

<I>see also</I> :

option<B> lavg, noticenotrun.</B>

<DT><B>noticenotrun</B>

<DD>
<I>boolean</I>(no)

<BR>

Should fcron mail user to report the non-execution of a %-job or a &amp;-job
(because of system down state for both or a too high system load average for
the latter).
<BR>

<I>see also</I> :

option<B> lavg, strict.</B>

<DT><B>tzdiff</B>

<DD>
<I>integer</I>(0)

<BR>

Time zone difference (in hours, between -24 and 24) between the system time,
and the local real time. This option allows a user to define its &amp; and %-lines
in the local time. Note that this value is set for a whole fcrontab file, and
only the last definition is taken into account.
<BR>

<I>see also</I> :

option<B> lavg, strict.</B>

</DL>
</DL>

<P>

A boolean argument can be inexistent, in which case brackets are not used and
it means true; the string &quot;true&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; or 1 to mean true; and the string
&quot;false&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or 0 to mean false. See above for explanations about time value
(section &quot;entries based on elapsed system up time&quot;).
<P>

Note that 
<B>dayand</B> and <B>dayor</B>

are in fact the same option : a false value to 
<B>dayand</B> is equivalent to a true to <B>dayor</B>,

and reciprocally a false value to 
<B>dayor</B> is equivalent a true value to <B>dayand</B>.

It is the same for
<B>lavgand</B> and <B>lavgor</B>.

<P>

Note a special case to be handled :
<BR>

A job should be entered into the 
<B>serial</B>

queue, *but*  the previous entry
for this job has not been completed yet, because of high system load or some
external event. Option 
<B>serialonce</B>

answers the question :  should the new entry of the job be ignored ?  This way
one can distinguish between jobs required to run a certain number of times,
preferably at specified times, and tasks to be performed irrespective of their
number (-&gt; serialonce(true)), which make the system respond faster.
<BR>

The same considerations apply for the load average queue, and can
be expressed with option
<B>lavgonce</B>.

<P>
Moreover, if the
<B>serial</B> or the <B>lavg</B>

queue contains respectively more than 30 and
30 jobs, the next job in the 
<B>serial</B> queue or the job nearest to the <B>until</B> timeout in the <B>lavg</B>

queue will be executed before adding a new job.
<P>

Finally, if jobs remain in the
<B>lavg</B> or <B>serial</B>

queues when fcron stops, they will be put once in the corresponding queue
on startup (their order may not be conserved).
<P>

An example of an option declaration would be :
<BR>

!reset,serial(true),dayor,bootrun(0),mailto(root),lavg(.5,2,1.5)
