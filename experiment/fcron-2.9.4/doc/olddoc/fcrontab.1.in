.SH DESCRIPTION
Fcrontab is the program intended to install, edit, list and remove the tables
used by
.BR fcron (8)
daemon. As fcron internally uses a non-human readable format (this is needed
because fcron saves more informations than the user gives, for example
the time and date of next execution), the user cannot edit directly
his fcrontab (the one used by fcron).
.PP
When a user installs a fcrontab, the source file is saved in the spool
directory 
.RI ( @@FCRONTABS@ )
to allow future editions, a formatted file is
generated for the fcron daemon, which is signaled once about ten seconds before
the next minute for all changes made previously. The daemon is not signaled
immediately to keep ill disposed users from blocking the daemon by installing
fcrontabs over and over.
.br
We will call "fcrontab" the source file of the fcrontab in the following.
.PP
A user can install a fcrontab if he is listed in the
.I @@ETC@/@@FCRON_ALLOW@
and not (unless by the keyword
.IR all ") listed in " @@ETC@/@@FCRON_DENY@
(see section "files" below). If neither fcron.allow nor fcron.deny
exist, every users are allowed. None of these files have to exist,
but if they do, the deny file takes precedence.
.PP
The first form of the command is used to install a new fcrontab file,
from any named file or from standard input if the pseudo-filename "-"
is given, replacing the previous one (if any) : each user can have only one
fcrontab.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -u
Specify the user whose fcrontab will be managed. Should only be used by root.
If not given, the fcrontab file of the user invoking 
.BR fcrontab(1) 
will be handled. It may be useful since the
.BR su (8)
command may confuse fcrontab.
.br
.RI "Note that the '" user "' in the synopsys"
.RB "is equivalent to a '" "-u" " "
.IR user '.
.TP
.B -l
List user's current fcrontab to standard output.
.TP
.B -e
Edit user's current fcrontab using either the editor specified by
the environment variable
.BR VISUAL ", or " EDITOR " if " VISUAL " is not set."
If none or them are set, 
.I @@EDITOR@
will be used.
.TP
.B -r
Remove user's fcrontab.
.TP
.B -z
Reinstall user's fcrontab from its source code. All informations fcron may have
kept in the binary fcrontab (such as the last execution time and date) will be
forgotten.
.TP
.B -n
Ignore previous version. If this option is not given, fcron will try to keep
as much information as possible between old and new version of the fcrontab
(time and date of next execution, if job is in serial queue, etc)
if the line hasn't been modified (same fields, same shell command).
.TP
.B -c f
Make fcrontab use config file f instead of default config file
@@ETC@/@@FCRON_CONF@. To interact with a running fcron process, fcrontab
must use the same config file as the process. That way, several fcron processes
can run simultaneously on an only system.
.TP
.B -d
Run in debug mode. In this mode, many informational messages will be output
in order to check if anything went wrong.
.TP
.B -h
Display a brief description of the options.
.TP
.B -V
Display an informational message about fcrontab, including its version
and the license under which it is distributed.

.SH RETURN VALUES
Fcrontab returns @@EXIT_OK@ on normal exit and @@EXIT_ERR@ on error.

.SH CONFORMING TO
Should be POSIX compliant. 

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @@ETC@/@@FCRON_CONF@
Configuration file for fcron and fcrontab : contains paths (spool dir,
pid file) and default programs to use (editor, shell, etc).
.RB "See " fcron.conf "(5) for more details."
.TP
.I @@ETC@/@@FCRON_ALLOW@
Users allowed to use fcrontab (one name per line, special name "all"
acts for everyone)
.TP
.I @@ETC@/@@FCRON_DENY@
Users who are not allowed to use fcrontab (same format as allow file)
.TP
.IR @@ETC@/pam.d/fcrontab " (or " @@ETC@/pam.conf ")"
PAM configuration file for fcrontab. Take a look at
.BR pam "(8) for more details."
