.SH NAME
fcrondyn \- dialog dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBfcrondyn\fR [ \fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR ] [ \fB-i\fR ]


\fBfcrondyn\fR [ \fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR ] \fB-x \fIcommand\fB\fR


\fBfcrondyn\fR [ \fB-h\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBFcrondyn\fR is a user tool intended to interact with a running
fcron daemon. It can, for instance, list user's jobs loaded by fcron, run one of
them, renice a running job, send a signal to a running job, etc.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Run \fBfcrondyn\fR in interactive mode. \fBfcrondyn\fR is also
run in interactive mode when no option is given.
.TP
\fB-x \fIcommand\fB\fR
Run \fIcommand\fR and returns
immediately. See below for syntax
and a list of commands.
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB\fR
Make \fBfcrontab\fR use config file
\fIfile\fR instead of default config file
\fI/etc/fcron.conf\fR. To interact with a running
\fBfcron\fR process, \fBfcrontab\fR must use the same config file as the process. That
way, several \fBfcron\fR processes can run simultaneously on an only system.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Run in debug mode. In this mode, many informational
messages will be output in order to check if anything went wrong.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Display a brief description of the options.
.TP

Display an informational message about \fBfcrontab\fR,
including its version and the license under which it is distributed.

If you're learning how to use fcron from scratch, I suggest
that you read the HTML version of the documentation (if your are not reading it
right now ! :) ) : the content is the same, but it is easier to navigate thanks
to the hyperlinks.
