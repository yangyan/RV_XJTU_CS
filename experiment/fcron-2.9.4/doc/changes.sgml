	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added a sum-up at the end of ./configure.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : "makewhatis" bug is fixed -- at last !</para>

	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : possible crash of fcron when trying to save a file
	    if there was no space left on device.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : we don't consider '-' and '_' as word delimiters for
	    a username before the command anymore, since many programs have one
	    of these characters in their name.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : option first was broken in fcron 2.9.3.</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 2.9.2 to 2.9.3</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>security issue : fcron used not to check the fcrontabs
	       installed by root for a standard user. This could make an
	       inattentive superuser install a user job runas(root)
	       involontary.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Perf improvement : we now use buffers to write something to
	       disk (became necessary due to the use of O_SYNC).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>To avoid loss of data in case of an hardware failure or a
	       system crash, fcron now saves files to a temporary name, and then
	       renames them to their definitive filename if everything's
	       ok.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>The PID indicated by fcrondyn is now the pid of the job itself

	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Implemented functions kill (send a signal to a running job)

	       fcrondyn.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added fcron's option -q to control the lavg and serial queue
	    sizes.
	    </para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added some timeouts in fcron for fcrondyn clients.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fcron is less restrictive concerning mailto addresses. In
	       particular, you can now use address like user@host.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : in 2.9.2, fcrontab and fcron did not set correctly
	       some file modes.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug (introduced in 2.9.1) : when a job stops with an non-zero
	       exit status or because it has been signaled, send a mail to its
	       owner to inform him (in 2.9.1 and 2.9.2, the mail was sent, but
	       contained nothing).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>code clean : use the same scheme for all struct types, removed
	       some code redundancy (save to disk management).</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 2.9.1 to 2.9.2</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added a system fcrontab. Root can access it with fcrontab by
	       using "-u systab".</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcrondyn's ls_lavgq, ls_serialq and ls_exeq are now
	    functional.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>mailto can now be set to a non-real user (for ex., an
	    alias).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcron now calls shutdown() when a connection from fcrondyn is
	       closed.  Another change in the code should prevent fcrondyn from
	       not returning to the prompt after a command has been run.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>use open() instead of fopen() to write files, for more
	    security.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcrontab sets euid=uid before running the editor. This is
	       required by some programs (for instance, perl).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : using DESTDIR with make did not work with the
	    doc.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Code clean : changed macros to make parameters clearly
	       different from vars.</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 2.9.0 to 2.9.1</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcron can now be run without root's privileges (<link
		  linkend="faq">see FAQ</link>)</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>added configure's option --with-boot-install .</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Minor change in the PAM code of fcron : may work better on
	       some systems.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>configure script now uses getpwnam() and getgrnam() instead of
	       reading directly /etc/passwd and /etc/group : this makes easier
	       the use of NIS, LDAP, etc.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Bug fix : using some "cmd > /dev/stderr" (or stdout) in a
	       script used to make fcron send a bogus output mail. (rewrite of
	       the code managing the output of jobs)</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Bug fix : typo error prevented fcrontab to be compiled on some
	       systems.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Minor bug fix about stdout option.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Minor bug fix : giving fcrontab's option -c a relative path
	       now works correctly.</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 2.1.0 to 2.9.0</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added some new options to fcron : -y, -o, -l ; and some
	       fcrontab options : stdout and volatile. All these permit to make
	       fcron run in foreground, execute all the pending jobs (mainly
	       %-jobs), and return. May be used, for instance, in a ppp-up
	       script with a dialup connection to update a software
	       regularly.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added fcrondyn : this software allows users to dialog
	       dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon. Currently, it can list
	       jobs of the user running it (or all jobs for root). In the near
	       future, it should be able to run a job, change its next time and
	       date of execution, renice a running job, send a signal to a
	       running job, etc.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>All the documentation has been ported to SGML DocBook.</para>
	    <para>It results on a much better HTML version, which I recommand
	    you use. It is installed by default in fcron documentation directory
	    (for instance, on my system :
	    <filename>/usr/share/doc/fcron-X.X.X/</filename>).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fcrontab.5 has been updated and improved. Some examples have
	       been added and some possible use of the different lines and
	       options are mentioned.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Added option random, which allows an entry run periodically to
	       be run at a random time in its intervals of execution, instead of
	       being run as soon as possible.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>added some more checks in fileconf.c : allow user to use
	       hours, days, hourly, daily, etc options only with %-lines : it is
	       ignored if set for a &-line, which is quite confusing for users
	       who may type, for instance "&amp;hourly" instead of
	       "%hourly".</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : you can now use arguments in the var EDITOR and
	       VISUAL.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : fcron used to call sometimes a sleep(-1), which
	       causes a freeze (no crash, but a very very long sleep :) ) under
	       system using LIBC5, and maybe on some non-linux systems. It was
	       not causing any problem under GLIBC2. Thanks go to Nick
	       Pasich.</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 2.0.0 to 2.1.0</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>PAM support for fcron and fcrontab (need testing ! - help
	       would be appreciated).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fcron now send a mail if a job has noticenotrun set and could
	       not be run because of a queue full.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>Fcron now compiles on AIX (thank you, John A. Parker !), and a
	       few AIX-only bugs have been fixed, but it may remain some
	       problems to correct.  Please try, and tell me !</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>We now use constants ROOTUID and ROOTGID instead of some
	       hard-coded "0", and those constants are defined by the configure
	       script (we use the uid/gid of the name given with the option
	       "--with-root{name|group}"). It allows fcron to be run on system
	       on which root is not uid/gid 0/0.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>code cleaning.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : setting lavg to (0,0,0) used to make the line be
	       added in the lavg queue instead of the serial queue (but the
	       lavgs were ignored anyway).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : fcrontab's "-z" option was not ignoring previous
	       user's fcrontab version.</para> </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : on systems using putenv(), the var HOME, USER and
	       SHELL wasn't correctly assigned. On system supporting setenv()
	       (which is the default), the problem did not occur. (thanks go to
	       Evan A. Zacks).</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>


      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 1.1.1 to 2.0.0</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>using SIGUSR2 on fcron makes it print its current schedule on
	       syslog and toggles on/off the printing of debug info on
	       syslog.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcron behavior on serial and lavg queues overflow has changed
	       : in previous versions, it used to run a job to make room to put
	       a new one. As it may conduct to a overwhelming of system
	       resources, the new job is now refused (and not run). An error
	       message is also logged through syslog.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>a mail is now sent if the job exited due to a signal, or if
	       exit status is non-zero. Read FAQ if you experience problems
	       about that.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>added a FAQ.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : a midmonthly job executed after the 15th of the
	       month used to cause an endless loop. Thanks go to Guy Geens
	       (thanks a lot !).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : inserting a job in serial queue or running a job
	       not finished at startup was broken, unless the job was
	       strict(no).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : some 1.1.1 changes used to make fcron impossible
	       to compile without sendmail (./configure's option
	       "--with-sendmail=no").</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed in sysV boot script : we know specify explicitly the
	       path to fcron.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fixed : unresolved error used to occur on some system not
	       defining getopt_long().</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 1.1.0 to 1.1.1</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>security fix : sym link attack against fcrontab. Any user
	       allowed to use fcrontab used to be able to remove any fcrontab,
	       and potentially to truncate any file to zero-length (under
	       certain conditions, anyway).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>fcron and fcrontab now have a configuration file : fcron.conf.
	       It contains the default paths (spool dir, etc) and programs to
	       use (editor, shell, etc). Thanks to that file, several fcron
	       processes can run simultaneously if they have a different config
	       (different spool dir and pid file).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>added fcron's option "-m" to control the number of serial jobs
	       which can be executed simultaneously.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>added fcron's option "-n" to create a new spool dir.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>command line syntax of fcrontab has changed : you can know use
	       "user" (after the file name if any) instead of "-u user". It
	       should make fcrontab a little more intuitive.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>It is now possible to put a user name between the time/date
	       fields and the shell command of a fcrontab line (for Vixie cron
	       format compatibility) : it is equivalent to runas(user).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>support of Solaris (and SysV).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>early support of OpenBSD.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>the installation scripts now use nsswitch.conf to detect if a
	       user or a group exists on the system. That way, naming services
	       (NYS, ldap, etc) are supported.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>the man page and doc is now installed by default in
	       $prefix/share/{man|doc} (instead of the previous
	       $prefix/{man|doc}) ($prefix is generally "/usr").</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : fcron used not to add a serial_sev line to
	       serial/lavg queue if this line was running, saying "already in
	       serial queue".</para>
	 </listitem>

	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug corrected : a "all" in fcron.allow with no fcron.deny file
	       was not considered as an allow rule.</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 1.0.3 to 1.1.0</title>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>The binary format of the binary fcrontabs has changed : there
	       is now no more need to reinstall the fcrontabs when upgrading
	       fcron (but you need to convert your fcrontabs to the new format
	       once), and this format should allow extensions without losing any
	       information.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>better management of the errors in load/save fcrontabs
	       functions.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>the doc is a clearer about @-lines.</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>more security tests by fcrontab in the case it is suid root
	       (but, if possible, it should be suid fcron as it is far more
	       secure).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>we now remove unwanted fcrontabs before loading them in memory
	       : well, it seems to be more logical like that :)) .</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : using options first with a &-line may have led to
	       some problems during the first read by fcron (mail send
	       erroneously if noticenotrun was used, bad set of the first
	       execution's time and date or immediate execution if bootrun was
	       set : in fact, the line was not recognized as a new line).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>bug fix : fcron used not to be able to be compiled from any
	       directory because of an absent -I. line option for the compiler
	       (the config.h file was not found).</para>
	 </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <itemizedlist>
	 <title>From version 1.0.2 to 1.0.3</title>

	    <para>bug corrected : installation script used not to check if user
	       fcron was in group fcron, in which case fcrontab doesn't work

	       fcrontab).</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>added options strict and noticenotrun to tell fcron
	       respectively if a job should be removed from lavg queue if its

	    <para>security improvement : after the (horrible) root exploit found
	       in version 0.9.3, I decided to improve fcron/fcrontab's
	       security. I've included some strong (I hope :)) ) tests in fcron
	       to ensure that only root can run commands as superuser and use
	       option runas. Even an corrupted fcrontab should not be able to
	       get root's privileges. Pretty reassuring, isn't it ?</para>
	 </listitem>
	 <listitem>
	    <para>runfreq(1) lines have been replaced and extended by a new kind

	       fcron to run a command once an hour, a week, etc, but only at
	       some specified moments. For instance : '%weekly * 4-7 echo "foo"'
	       will run the command 'echo "foo"' once a week between 4 and 7 in
	       the morning. (see "man 5 fcrontab" for more details).</para>

	    <para>installation process improved : user is now consulted before
