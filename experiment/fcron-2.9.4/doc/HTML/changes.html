>security issue : fcron used not to check the fcrontabs
	       installed by root for a standard user. This could make an
	       inattentive superuser install a user job runas(root)
	       involontary.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Perf improvement : we now use buffers to write something to
	       disk (became necessary due to the use of O_SYNC).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>To avoid loss of data in case of an hardware failure or a
	       system crash, fcron now saves files to a temporary name, and then
	       renames them to their definitive filename if everything's
	       ok.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The PID indicated by fcrondyn is now the pid of the job itself
	       (up to now, it was the one of the fcron process controlling the
	       job).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Implemented functions kill (send a signal to a running job)
	       and renice (change the priority of a running job) in
	       fcrondyn.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Added fcron's option -q to control the lavg and serial queue
	    sizes.
	    </P

><LI
><P
>Added some timeouts in fcron for fcrondyn clients.</P

>Fcron is less restrictive concerning mailto addresses. In
	       particular, you can now use address like user@host.</P

>bug fix : in 2.9.2, fcrontab and fcron did not set correctly
	       some file modes.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>bug (introduced in 2.9.1) : when a job stops with an non-zero
	       exit status or because it has been signaled, send a mail to its
	       owner to inform him (in 2.9.1 and 2.9.2, the mail was sent, but
	       contained nothing).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>code clean : use the same scheme for all struct types, removed
	       some code redundancy (save to disk management).</P
></LI
></UL
><P

><B
>From version 2.9.1 to 2.9.2</B

	       using "-u systab".</P
></LI

>fcrondyn's ls_lavgq, ls_serialq and ls_exeq are now
	    functional.</P

	    alias).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>fcron now calls shutdown() when a connection from fcrondyn is
	       closed.  Another change in the code should prevent fcrondyn from
	       not returning to the prompt after a command has been run.</P
></LI

>use open() instead of fopen() to write files, for more
	    security.</P

>From version 2.1.0 to 2.9.0</B
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Added some new options to fcron : -y, -o, -l ; and some
	       fcrontab options : stdout and volatile. All these permit to make
	       fcron run in foreground, execute all the pending jobs (mainly
	       %-jobs), and return. May be used, for instance, in a ppp-up
	       script with a dialup connection to update a software
	       regularly.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Added fcrondyn : this software allows users to dialog
	       dyn-amically with a running fcron daemon. Currently, it can list
	       jobs of the user running it (or all jobs for root). In the near
	       future, it should be able to run a job, change its next time and
	       date of execution, renice a running job, send a signal to a
	       running job, etc.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>All the documentation has been ported to SGML DocBook.</P
><P
>It results on a much better HTML version, which I recommand
	    you use. It is installed by default in fcron documentation directory
	    (for instance, on my system :
	    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/share/doc/fcron-X.X.X/</TT
>).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Fcrontab.5 has been updated and improved. Some examples have
	       been added and some possible use of the different lines and
	       options are mentioned.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Added option random, which allows an entry run periodically to
	       be run at a random time in its intervals of execution, instead of
	       being run as soon as possible.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>added some more checks in fileconf.c : allow user to use
	       hours, days, hourly, daily, etc options only with %-lines : it is
	       ignored if set for a &#38;-line, which is quite confusing for users
	       who may type, for instance "&#38;hourly" instead of
	       "%hourly".</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>bug fixed : you can now use arguments in the var EDITOR and
	       VISUAL.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>bug fixed : fcron used to call sometimes a sleep(-1), which
	       causes a freeze (no crash, but a very very long sleep :) ) under
	       system using LIBC5, and maybe on some non-linux systems. It was
	       not causing any problem under GLIBC2. Thanks go to Nick
	       Pasich.</P

	       "--with-root{name|group}"). It allows fcron to be run on system

>fcron behavior on serial and lavg queues overflow has changed

	       certain conditions, anyway).</P

>fcron and fcrontab now have a configuration file : fcron.conf.
	       It contains the default paths (spool dir, etc) and programs to

	       processes can run simultaneously if they have a different config

	       to ensure that only root can run commands as superuser and use
	       option runas. Even an corrupted fcrontab should not be able to
	       get root's privileges. Pretty reassuring, isn't it ?</P

	       some specified moments. For instance : '%weekly * 4-7 echo "foo"'
