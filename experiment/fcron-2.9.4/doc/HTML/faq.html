CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>       First, you must understand that fcron determines, for each job, its next
time and date of execution. It then determines which of those jobs would be the
next to run and then, sleeps until that job should be run. In other words, fcron
doesn't wake up like Vixie cron each minute to check all job in case one should
be run ... and it avoids some problems associated with clock adjusts.</P
><P
>       This means that if the new time value is set into the past, fcron won't
run a particular job again. For instance, suppose the real time and system clock
are 3:00, so the next job cannot be scheduled to run before 3:00, as it would
have already been run and re-scheduled.</P
><P
>       First, suppose you set your system clock into the past, say to 2:00,
Presuming that the last run was shortly before 3:00. then fcron will sleep until
the next job should be executed. The execution time for a job is determined by
identifying the last time that the job ran and computing the next scheduled
time. This means that the next scheduled time must be on or after 3:01.
Therefore, in this example, fcron will not run a job for at least one
hour.</P
><P
>       Next, if you set the system time into the future, say to 4:00, fcron will
run every job scheduled between the old and the new time value once, regardless
of how many times it would have been scheduled. When fcron wakes up to run a job
after the time value has changed, it runs all the jobs which should have run
during the interval because they are scheduled to run in a past time.</P
><P
>       As special case is when "@xxx" style scheduling rules are involved, you
must consider the "adjustment-interval". The "adjustment-interval" is the time
difference between the original system time and the new system time. If the ...
 run at "adjust-interval" too
early or too late depending of the nature of the adjust.</P
><P
>       To conclude, fcron behaves quite well for small clock adjusts. Each job
which should have run does so once, but not exactly at the correct time as if
the job were scheduled within the adjustment interval. But, if you have to make
a big change in the time and date, you should probably reset all the scheduled
"nextexe" by running "fcrontab -z" on all the fcrontabs.</P

><B

if you still want to receive the standard output as mail, you can add an command
which always evaluates to 0, like "/bin/true", after your primary command. This
will not affect your job nor create additional output. For example:</P

CLASS="ANSWER"
><P
><B
> </B
>      The "/proc/loadavg" file provides loadavg values. These values are (in
order): the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes; a count of
the (active tasks/active processes); the pid of last process run;
		</P
><P
>      The active task count includes those processes marked as running or
uninterruptable. A load average is an estimate of the average number of
processes running within a specified period. The load averages are computed from
active task count. They are updated each time active task counts are taken.

5 seconds; n is the time over which the readings are averaged.
